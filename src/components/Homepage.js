                                Glass used to make salsa jars, iced tea bottles, and other food packages can be recycled. Glass from cookware, storage containers, windows, and most lightbulbs are not able to be recycled. Here are some options for recycling glass:
                                <br/>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><u>Recycling bins:</u> dispose of your glass in a curbside recyling bin.</li>
                                    <li><u>Drop-off centers:</u> any glass containers that you recycle at a drop-off center that have a CRV value can allow you to recieve compensation.</li>
                                    <li><u>Find alternative uses:</u> turn an old jar into a flower vase, use glass bottles as reusable water bottles, use them as storage containers, etc. Be creative. </li>

                            Everyone goes through old clothes, which is why it is important to recycle them. However, unlike items that are recycled, old clothes can fill up landfills, negatively affecting the environment. Here are some ways you can recycle them without harming the planet:
                                <br/>
                                <ul style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
                                    <li><u>Donate:</u> this is keeps clothes out of landfills and into the hands of people who will actually use it. It can also help those in need because it will be more affordable.</li>
                                    <li><u>Sell:</u> the same reasoning as donating still applies, but instead you earn money.</li>
                                    <li><u>Reuse:</u> make something out of your old clothing. Many people use old clothes as rags or make diy projects with them. </li>
                                </ul>
